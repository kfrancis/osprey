# Osprey VS Code Extension - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The Osprey VS Code Extension enables developers to write, edit, and execute Osprey programming language code within Visual Studio Code. Osprey is a new functional programming language with a focus on clarity, safety, and performance.

## Goals
1. Provide a fully functional development environment for Osprey programming in VS Code
2. Implement comprehensive language features through the Language Server Protocol (LSP)
3. Integrate with TaskMaster to help developers manage Osprey project development
4. Implement a simple but functional compiler/interpreter for Osprey

## Key Features

### 1. Basic Language Support
- Syntax highlighting for Osprey (.osp) files
- Auto-indentation and bracket matching
- Comment toggling
- Code folding

### 2. Language Server Features
- Error diagnostics with clear error messages
- Code completion for keywords and built-in functions
- Hover information for symbols
- Symbol definitions and references
- Document outline/structure

### 3. Compiler Integration
- Command to compile Osprey files
- Command to run compiled Osprey programs
- Error reporting in the Problems panel

### 4. TaskMaster Integration
- TaskMaster tasks for common Osprey actions
- Project templates for Osprey applications
- Build tasks for Osprey projects

### 5. Development Tools
- Embedded Osprey compiler/interpreter
- Configuration options for compiler settings
- Debug capabilities

## Technical Requirements
1. The extension should work without requiring a separate installation of the Osprey compiler
2. Changes to Osprey files should trigger compilation in the background for quick feedback
3. The extension should provide detailed diagnostic information for syntax and semantic errors
4. Performance should be optimized for large Osprey files and projects

## Dependencies
- VS Code Extensions API
- Language Server Protocol
- Node.js for the extension runtime
- A simplified Osprey compiler/interpreter (to be bundled with the extension)

## Out of Scope
- Full-featured Osprey language implementation
- Debugging with breakpoints and variable inspection (future enhancement)
- Refactoring tools (future enhancement)
- Project scaffolding (future enhancement)

## Success Criteria
1. Users can write, compile, and run Osprey programs entirely within VS Code
2. The extension provides immediate feedback on syntax and semantic errors
3. Basic language features (completion, hover, go-to-definition) work reliably
4. TaskMaster integration helps users manage Osprey development tasks
