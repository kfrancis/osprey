# Cross-Platform Improvements for Osprey VSCode Extension

## Extension Architecture and Robustness

Based on best practices from the VS Code C# extension (dotnet/vscode-csharp), this extension implements:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Custom event system for error handling and telemetry
   - Consistent status reporting across components
   - Structured error handling with actionable feedback

2. **Enhanced Status Indicators**
   - Interactive status bar with context menu
   - Multiple status states (starting, running, error, stopped)
   - Quick access to common actions

3. **Robust Initialization**
   - Graceful failure handling during startup
   - Server health checks
   - Compiler availability verification

## Cross-Platform Improvements

1. **Cross-Platform Compiler Bundle Scripts**
   - Created `bundle-compiler.sh` for Unix-like platforms (Linux, macOS)
   - Enhanced existing `bundle-compiler.ps1` for Windows
   - Added automatic executable permissions handling for Unix systems

2. **Multi-Tier Path Handling**
   - Priority-based compiler resolution: user settings → PATH → bundled compiler
   - Platform-specific path detection and validation
   - Multiple fallback mechanisms with detailed logging
   - Support for multiple compiler file formats (.exe, .cmd, shell scripts)

3. **NPM Scripts**
   - Cross-platform npm scripts in package.json
   - Platform-agnostic `bundle-compiler` script that works on all platforms
   - Postinstall/prepublish hooks to ensure compiler is bundled properly

4. **Enhanced Configuration**
   - Cross-platform configuration settings
   - Improved compiler path resolution that works on all operating systems
   - Proper path variable substitution for workspace-relative paths
   - Reset settings command to recover from misconfigurations

5. **Better Error Handling and User Experience**
   - Detailed error logging with context information
   - Interactive notifications with multiple action options
   - Dedicated output channels for different operations
   - Command history and caching for performance

## Testing

To verify cross-platform compatibility:

1. **Windows**
   - Run `npm run bundle-compiler` to bundle the Windows-compatible compiler
   - Test compilation and execution using the bundled compiler
   - Verify path handling with both absolute and workspace-relative paths
   - Test with different Node.js versions and installation methods

2. **macOS/Linux**
   - Make `bundle-compiler.sh` executable: `chmod +x scripts/bundle-compiler.sh`
   - Run `npm run bundle-compiler` to bundle the Unix-compatible compiler
   - Test compilation and execution using the bundled compiler
   - Verify permissions are correctly set on the executable files
   - Test with both bash and other shells

3. **Cross-Platform Testing Matrix**
   - Compiler path in settings: none, absolute, relative with variables
   - Node.js availability: global install, local install, none
   - File permissions: correct, incorrect (executable bit)
   - PATH environment: compiler in PATH, not in PATH
   - Workspace configuration: single folder, multi-folder, no folder

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated CI Testing**
   - GitHub Actions workflows to test on all platforms
   - Matrix testing of various configurations
   - Verify compiler bundling and execution on Windows, macOS, and Linux

2. **Advanced Platform-Specific Error Handling**
   - Enhanced error messages with platform-specific troubleshooting tips
   - Automatic detection and correction of common issues
   - Self-healing capabilities for permissions and path issues

3. **Installer and Update Improvements**
   - Platform-specific installers for simplified deployment
   - Auto-detect and adapt to platform differences during installation
   - Seamless updates that preserve user configuration
